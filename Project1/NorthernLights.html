        <p> <em> THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA </em> borealis, or northern lights, begin high
            in the Earth's atmosphere—at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when
            charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic
            field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show. </p>

      <p> <em> THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA </em> borealis, or northern lights, begin
          high in the Earth's atmosphere—at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when
          charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic
          field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show. <br> <br>
          The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica.
          Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you'd like to take in these
          shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere
          with a magnetic latitude above 55&deg and low light pollution. Find your
          magnetic latitude on NOAA and here. <br> <br>
          In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights
          are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September,
          the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the
          atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September,
          when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours
          of your location here, or by using a sky guide app. </p>
